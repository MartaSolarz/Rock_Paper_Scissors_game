### 1. General information and game rules ###

One of the simplest and most popular party games for two or more players.The game consists of consecutive turns. In each turn, both players quickly place their hand in front of them, showing the symbol of **paper, stone, or scissors**, upon the agreed signal. The player with the stronger symbol scores one point. In the case of showing two of the same symbols, there is a draw - no point. 

Here is the hierarchy of symbols:
* scissors are stronger than paper because they cut it,
* stone is stronger than scissors because it blunts them,
* paper is stronger than stone because it wraps it.

The player who gets the number of points agreed in advance wins the game.
